Linux does not need that we type the extensions
file .face shows what type of file is the .face doc is. Ex. JPG image

TO FIND FILES:
locate asig : It shows all the file names with that string.

which cal: finds other commands for me, ex. cal. It shows it is installed and
where it is.  ex. /usr/bin/cal
If we then type cal and Enter we will run the command and we will see this month's
calendar on the screen.

1st option: up arrow

CREATE NEW DIRECTORIES & FILES:
mkdir Test1 Test2 Test3:  we can create more than 1 directory all at one.
touch existing_file: it updates the date on that file, ex. to backup a file.

TIP: ALtGran + 4= ~ in a Spanish keyboard

COPY FILES:

cp ~/Documentos/NetNinja_CSS_HTML_Crash_Course/about2.html about3.html: to cpoy it in a different folder
cp about3.html about4.html (copy file in same folder. The copyÅ› name is about4.html)

MOVE & REMOVE FILES AND DIRECTORIES
mv : move and rename files. If we move a file to another file the file will disappear
and its content will be added to the 2nd file. Ex. mv lucia.txt  ~/Documents/

rm: remove. No possible to retrieve it -> BE CAREFUL
rm file1 / rm * (delete all the files of a folder) / rm file* (delete any file that 
starts with the word file
rm * does not delete subdirectories -> rm -r foldername; delete subdirectories

rmdir: only removes empty directories ex. rmdir * 
Ex. rmdir: failed to remove 'dir1': Directory not empty
    rmdir: failed to remove 'lucia.txt': Not a directory

** TEXT FILES ***
cat print the content of a file on the screen.
cat >> file2 : means anything that cat has, add it to file2. If we start typing some text,
we must end the text with Control+D. Then if we type cat file2 we will see that text inside 
that file.
cat file1 file2 : print the content of both files but the files remain the same.


more & less

more file1: pages the content of a file
less file1: more + more things. Not only pages the file, it also allows us to search text..
